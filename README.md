## Background

This library provides accessibility-compliant `Twirl` basic building blocks as originally implemented in the [govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/)
library. Additionally, it provides a layout that wraps the `GovukTemplate`, used across all frontends, and we plan to 
include more helpers built on top of `Play's` own helpers and the basic components.
The following figure illustrates the components and their dependencies (zoom in for a better view).

## Getting started

### Installation

For most developers, this library should be brought in via [play-frontend-hmrc](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-hmrc). 
This means that you do **NOT** need to add this library as a dependency of your project. Instead, follow the 
instructions to add [play-frontend-hmrc](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-hmrc) to your project, and that library 
will manage asset compilations, routes, etc.

If you do need to use this library directly, follow the [standalone instructions](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk/blob/master/docs/maintainers/standalone.md).

### Using govuk-frontend Components in Twirl
To use the [govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/) `Twirl` [components](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk/blob/master/src/main/play-26/uk/gov/hmrc/govukfrontend/views/html/components/package.scala) 
and all the [types](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk/blob/master/src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/govukfrontend/views/Aliases.scala) needed to construct them, import the following:
```scala
@import uk.gov.hmrc.govukfrontend.views.html.components._
```

### Twirl HTML helper methods and implicits
The above import will also bring into scope the available `Twirl` [helpers](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk/blob/master/src/main/play-26/uk/gov/hmrc/govukfrontend/views/Helpers.scala) and [layouts](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk/blob/master/src/main/play-26/uk/gov/hmrc/govukfrontend/views/Layouts.scala).

The following import will summon [implicits](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk/blob/master/src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/govukfrontend/views/Implicits.scala) that provide extension methods on `Play's` [FormError](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/api/scala/play/api/data/FormError.html) 
to convert between `Play's` form errors and view models used by `GovukErrorMessage` and `GovukErrorSummary` (E.g. **form.errors.asTextErrorLinks**, **form.errors.asTextErrorMessageForField**): 
```scala
@import uk.gov.hmrc.govukfrontend.views.html.components.implicits._

...
    @formWithCSRF(action = routes.NameController.onSubmit(mode)) {

    @if(form.errors.nonEmpty) {
      @errorSummary(ErrorSummary(errorList = form.errors.asTextErrorLinks, title = Text(messages("error.summary.title"))))
    }

      @input(Input(id = "value", name = "value", value = form.value,
        errorMessage = form.errors.asTextErrorMessageForField(fieldKey = "value"),
        label = Label(isPageHeading = true, classes = "govuk-label--l", content = Text(messages("name.heading"))))) 
 }
...
```

It also provides extension methods on `Play's` [Html](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/api/scala/play/twirl/api/Html.html) objects.
This includes HTML trims, pads, indents and handling HTML emptiness.

### An example usage of [GovukLayout](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk/blob/master/src/main/play-26/twirl/uk/gov/hmrc/govukfrontend/views/layouts/govukLayout.scala.html) template
A convenient way of setting up a view with standard structure and Govuk design elements is provided. 
Instead of directly invoking GovukTemplate, use GovukLayout and pass in GovUk assets wiring in head and scripts elements. 
The following example snippet sets up a common local layout shared by view pages which then delegates to the standard GovukLayout. 
```scala
@this(
  govukLayout: GovukLayout,
  head: head,
  scripts: scripts
)

@(pageTitle: Option[String] = None,
  beforeContentBlock: Option[Html] = None
)(contentBlock: Html)(implicit request: Request[_], messages: Messages)

@govukLayout(
  pageTitle = pageTitle,
  headBlock = Some(head()),
  beforeContentBlock = beforeContentBlock,
  footerItems = Seq(FooterItem(
    href = Some("https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/"), 
    text = Some("GOV.UK Prototype Kit v9.1.0"))),
  bodyEndBlock = Some(scripts()))(contentBlock)
```
The above snippet uses some sensible defaults (e.g. initial language) and configs (e.g. header config) to render a page. 
One of the optional parameters of GovukLayout is _headerBlock_. It can be composed of [Header](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk/blob/master/src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/govukfrontend/views/viewmodels/header/Header.scala) element. 
However, if no header block is passed in but simply the following i18n message keys being present, the following Header element is constructed:
```scala
Header(
  homepageUrl = Some(messages("service.homePageUrl")),
  serviceName = Some(messages("service.name")),
  serviceUrl = Some(messages("service.homePageUrl")),
  containerClasses = Some("govuk-width-container")
)
```
The above snippet is based on the premise that a header could be in different languages when supporting i18n standards. <br/>
GovukLayout leverages local head and scripts template for assets wiring. 
The local head view template looks like the following:
```html
@this()

@()
<!--[if lte IE 8]><link href='@controllers.routes.Assets.versioned("stylesheets/application-ie-8.css")' rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /><![endif]-->
<!--[if gt IE 8]><!--><link href='@controllers.routes.Assets.versioned("stylesheets/application.css")' media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /><!--<![endif]-->
```
The local scripts view template looks like the following:
```html
@this()

@()
<script src='@controllers.routes.Assets.versioned("lib/govuk-frontend/govuk/all.js")'></script>
<script>window.GOVUKFrontend.initAll();</script>
```
The head view template requires the following application.scss in app/assets/stylesheets folder which gets compiled to application.css by [sbt-sassify](https://github.com/irundaia/sbt-sassify)
```
$govuk-assets-path: "/play-mtp-frontend/assets/lib/govuk-frontend/govuk/assets/";

@import "lib/govuk-frontend/govuk/all";

.app-reference-number {
  display: block;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
Please note that the /play-mtp-frontend/ in $govuk-assets-path is the context root path of the frontend using the library.

A reference implementation can be found in [play-mtp-twirl-frontend](https://github.com/hmrc/play-mtp-twirl-frontend)

## Usage

The library is cross-compiled for `Play 2.6` and `Play 2.7`.

**As of v0.57.0 (January 2021), this library will no longer be cross-compiled against Play 2.5.**

### Play 2.6

The same namespace exposes type aliases prefixed with `Govuk` (ex: the type `GovukButton`) so that components can be injected into 
a controller or template. It also exposes values of the same name (ex: `GovukButton`) if you wish to use the component template directly, 
though it is preferable to use dependency injection.

Same button using DI:
```scala
@import uk.gov.hmrc.govukfrontend.views.html.components._

@this(govukButton: GovukButton)

@()
@govukButton(Button(
  disabled = true,
  content = Text("Disabled button")
))
```

### Example Templates

We provide example templates using the Twirl components through a `Chrome` extension. Please refer to the 
[extension's github repository](https://github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-govuk-extension) for installation instructions.

With the extension installed, you should be able to go to the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/), 
click on a component on the sidebar and see the `Twirl` examples matching the provided `Nunjucks` templates.

_Note: Currently there are examples only for the following components:_

* [Back link](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/back-link/) 
* [Button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/)
* [Details](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/)
* [Error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/)
* [Error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/)
* [Fieldset](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/fieldset/)
* [Footer](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/)
* [Header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/)
* [Panel](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/panel/)
* [Radios](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/)
* [Summary list](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/)
* [Textarea](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/textarea/)
* [Text input](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/)

## API

As of v0.63.0, a method `withFormField(field: play.api.data.Field)` method has been added to the following classes:
* CharacterCount
* Checkboxes
* Input
* Radios
* Select
* Textarea

This new method allows a Play forms Field to be passed through when creating an instance of `play-frontend-govuk` form input,
which will enrich the input with the following:
* Using the `Field` name for the input name
* Using the `Field` name for the input id or idPrefix
* Using the `Field` error message
* Using the `Field` value as pre-filled value (for `CharacterCount`, `Input`, `Textarea`) or pre-selected value 
  (`Checkboxes`, `Radios`, `Select`)
  
The methods can be used as methods in a Twirl template as demonstrated below:
```
@import uk.gov.hmrc.govukfrontend.views.html.components.implicits._

@this(govukInput)

@(label: String, field: Field)(implicit messages: Messages)

@govukInput(
  Input(
    label = Label(classes = labelClasses, content = Text(label))
  ).withFormField(field)
)
```

If a value is passed though to the input `.apply()` method during construction, it will NOT be overwritten by the 
`Field` values. These are only used if the object parameters are not set to the default parameters.

Note that you will need to pass through an implicit `Messages` to your template.

## Dependencies

### sbt Dependencies

The library depends on a `govuk-frontend` artifact published as a webjar.

```sbt
"org.webjars.npm" % "govuk-frontend" % "x.y.z"
```

Currently GDS does not automate the publishing of the webjar so it has to be manually published from [WebJars](https://www.webjars.org) after a `govuk-frontend` release.

## Getting help

Please report any issues with this library in Slack at `#event-play-frontend-beta`.

For other issues or wider discussions, please use `#team-plat-ui`.

## Contributing

PlatUI and this repository is responsible for providing a means to access GOV.UK components in Play/Twirl.
However, the underlying components, their design and surrounding user research are owned by GDS under GOV.UK.

If you would like to propose a feature, you should raise this with GDS and the wider design community.

If you have an issue with the underlying govuk-frontend implementation, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/new) for them to address directly.
You could also look at raising a feature request there too.

Should GOV.UK accept your feature request, it will then be available in Twirl once the appropriate upgrade is made in this repository to match that version upgrade.
